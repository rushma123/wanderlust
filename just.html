		<p class="copy" width align="justify"style="font-size: 20px;">Kathmandu, Nepal's capital, is set in a valley surrounded by the Himalayan mountains. At the heart of the old city’s mazelike alleys is Durbar Square, which becomes frenetic during Indra Jatra, a religious festival featuring masked dances.  The Pashupatinath Temple is a famous and sacred Hindu temple complex that is located on the banks of the Bagmati River, approximately 5 km north-east of Kathmandu in the eastern part of Kathmandu Valley,the capital of Nepal. The temple serves as the seat of Pashupatinath. This temple complex was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage Sites's list in 1979. This "extensive Hindu temple precinct" is a "sprawling collection of temples, ashrams, images and inscriptions raised over the centuries along the banks of the sacred Bagmati river" and is included as one of the seven monument groups in UNESCO's designation of Kathmandu Valley as visit here.
The temple is one of the 275 Tamil Paadal Petra Sthalams (Holy Abodes of Shiva) on the continent. Kotirudra Samhita, Chapter 11 on the Shivalingas of the North, in Shiva Purana mentions this Shivalinga as the bestower of all wishes.

		<br><p class="copy" width align="justify"style="font-size: 20px;">Located 22km west of Siddharthanagar (Bhairawa), Lumbini was the birthplace of one of history’s most revered figures, Siddhartha Gautama – better known as the historical Buddha – in the 7th century BC. During the years following the Buddha's lifetime, this was a teeming monastic complex and a major place of pilgrimage, but the site was lost to history until the discovery in 1896 of an inscribed pillar left behind by the Buddhist emperor Ashoka, amidst a sea of monastery ruins.The birth took place in the beautiful Sal grove, which is now the focal point of the Lumbini Garden. Mayadevi, the Queen of Shakya King Suddhodhana of Kapilvastu, while passing through the Lumbini Garden, on the day of  Baishakha Purnima (full moon day of May in 623 BC) took a bath in the the Sacred Pond Pushkarini and soon after gave birth to Prince Siddhartha.

		<br><p class="copy" width align="justify"style="font-size: 20px;">Mustang trek is an exploration of the concealed valleys of upper Mustang in Nepal. Interestingly it nestled between Tibet and the Himalayas – a place different from the rest of the world. The wall city of Lomanthang used to be a part of Tibetan kingdom of Gungthang until 1830s. The early history of Lomanthang is embellished in myths and legends rather then the recorded facts. Even though the upper Mustang is changing it still surprises the visitors with its stunning vista and the stubborn way it cling to its unique culture. Indeed the culture is fighting back, crumbing art works are being restored. Crumbing monasteries have been rebuilt and refilled with the sound of bald-headed children in robes studying the ancient Buddhist ways.

Built in the 17th century, the palaces, courtyards and temples of the Patan Durbar are the city’s star attractions. With its multi-columned façade and gilded spires, the recently restored stone Krishna Temple is particularly striking, as is the recently restored Sundari Chowk, a courtyard with an elaborately carved sunken bath as its centerpiece. Patan is one of the best places in Nepal to buy the gorgeous handmade silk saris that once were the garment of choice for the country’s royalty and aristocracy.
