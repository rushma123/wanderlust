<br><p class="copy" width>Nestled in the hills about an hour's drive from Lakeside lies the serene, accommodating stretch of teashops and lodges and the take off point for the Annapurna Base Camp trek. There isn't much to see in Hemja itself but the drive there is exceptionally lovely with roads stretched for miles and evenings are the best for a nice drive down cornfields and old-fashioned mud-and-straw huts. Be sure to stop at the Tibetan Refugee Camp on the way for yummy servings of lovely momos and lafing. Once in Hemja, try a cup of their hot farm-fresh dudh-chiya at one of the many teashops there; it'll certainly freshen you up!<br><br>

<br><p class="copy" width>Once an unknown spot, Khapaudi is quickly turning into one of the most-frequented destinations in Pokhara. Tired of the noisy Lakeside buzz, locals and tourists alike have started flocking to this more serene and tranquil haven laced with greenery and pitched right next to the calm Fewa lake. Eating fish is a must here and Duna Tapari do the best Nepali-styled BBQ fish you will ever taste in Pokhara. Grab a chilled beer and watch high-flying paragliders and eagles glide across the sky in the evening. If you crave a spicy snack, try the family-run Newari restaurant Khya, which is the perfect spot for a sundowner.<br><br>

	<center><img src="damside.jpg" height="300" width="500" border="0"></center>
<br><p class="copy" width>It's a sad fact that the once-bustling hub of Damside is now almost neglected by tourists and has morphed into a sleepy street lined with sekuwa-houses and small grocery shops mostly frequented by locals looking for a place to indulge in cheap booze. Damside obviously hasn't lost its beauty and if you do happen to go there, check out the Don't Pass Me By Restaurant and try their Spaghetti Napolitana  (they do an awesome marinara!) if they're serving (they sometimes don't). Grab a beer and sit in their large wooden chairs and relax in their magnificent garden..<br><br>

	<h3 class="text-center"  align="center">Bindabasini Mandir</h3>
	<center><img src="binda.jpg" height="300" width="500" border="0"></center>
<br><p class="copy" width>You may not be the religious type but visit the legendary Bindabasini Mandir anyway to soak in the ever present smell of incense, butter-lamps, and puja-offerings. Surrounding the Mandir is the old market with old-fashioned stores that sell everything from puja-offerings to chic, modern clothing. Try one of the many bustling tea shops there and enjoy some fresh, yum sel-rotis and dudh-chiya. Or try heavenly sweets at any of the Marwadi sweetshops there.
