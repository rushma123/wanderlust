The architecture of the temple is traditional pagoda-style like the other shrines in the region. The modestly quaint temple is flocked by pilgrims during the occasion of Ram Navami and Dashain which are sacred and important annual festivals dedicated to Lord Rama. The opulent temple is a perfect attraction for those interested in exploring ancient cultures and experiencing its divine vibe.<br><br>
