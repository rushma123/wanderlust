	<center><img src="swoyambhu.jpg" height="300" width="500" border="0"></center>

<br><p class="copy" width>Swayambhu  is an ancient religious architecture atop a hill in the Kathmandu Valley, west of Kathmandu city. The Tibetan name for the site means 'Sublime Trees' , for the many varieties of trees found on the hill. However, Shing.kun may be a corruption of the local Nepal Bhasa name for the complex, Swayambhu, meaning 'self-sprung'.For the Buddhist Newars, in whose mythological history and origin myth as well as day-to-day religious practice Swayambhunath occupies a central position, it is probably the most sacred among Buddhist pilgrimage sites. For Tibetans and followers of Tibetan Buddhism, it is second only to Boudha.

	<center><img src="ktmdt.jpg" height="300" width="500" border="0"></center>
<br><p class="copy" width>Kathmandu Durbar Square  in front of the old royal palace of the former Kathmandu Kingdom is one of three Durbar (royal palace) Squares in the Kathmandu Valley in Nepal, all of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
Several buildings in the Square collapsed due to a major earthquake on 25 April 2015. Durbar Square was surrounded with spectacular architecture and vividly showcases the skills of the Newar artists and craftsmen over several centuries. The Royal Palace was originally at Dattaraya square and was later moved to the Durbar square.
The Kathmandu Durbar Square held the palaces of the Malla and Shah kings who ruled over the city. Along with these palaces, the square surrounds quadrangles, revealing courtyards and temples. It is known as Hanuman Dhoka Durbar Square, a name derived from a statue of Hanuman, the monkey devotee of Lord Ram, at the entrance of the palace.

	<center><img src="boudha.jpg" height="300" width="500" border="0"></center>
<br><p class="copy" width>Situated at a distance of about 11 kilometres from the city centre of Kathmandu, Boudhanath Stupa dominates the Kathmandu skyline with its gargantuan spherical shape. Thousands of pilgrims from different religions gather here daily. They perform a ritualistic circumnavigation, known as the 'kora', of the colossal dome. It is believed that anyone who circumambulates the stupa with no ill thoughts in their hearts receives good karma. Moreover, the gates of hell are permanently closed for them!
The massive mandala of this magisterial stupa makes it the largest in Nepal and the continent. In1979, Boudhanath Stupa was honoured as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Boudhanath Stupa has acquired several names throughout the years, including the Buddha Stupa, Chorten Chempo, Chaitya, Jarung Khashor, and the Khasti. The entire complex of the stupa houses 50 Tibetan convents, known as gompas, which have been acting as shelters for the Tibetan refugees since 1959. This stupa is said to be the spot where the remains of Kassapa Buddha lay in rest.

	<center><img src="pashupati.jpg" height="300" width="500" border="0"></center>
<br><p class="copy" width>One of the holiest Hindu shrines in Nepal, the Pashupatinath Temple is stretched across both the banks of the beautiful and sacred Bagmati River on the eastern fringes of the capital city of Kathmandu. The magnificent sanctum devoted to Lord Shiva draws in thousands of devotees who come to offer their prayers and seek blessings from him. Sprawled over a large area with temples and ashrams, it is believed that the Jyotirlinga housed in the Pashupatinath temple is the head of the body which is made up of the twelve Jyotirlinga in India. In 1979, the magnificent temple was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
