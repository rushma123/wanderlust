<br><p class="copy" width>There are so many gods who are worshipped in Hinduism. But something as curious a God hybrid comes less often. And this temple is the perfect example of the same. This three storey temple, which is dedicated to Hari Shankar is as curious as it can get. The deity is considered an amalgamation or a hybrid of Vishnu and Shiva, the attributes of both have been taken together.
This temple is intriguing and not only for the hybrid deity. The Hindu temple manages to intrigue with its roof struts and architecture. The temple, which was designed in the 1704-05 by King Yoganarendra Malla's daughter is quite popular and located in close proximity to the other temples. The temple was destroyed in the 2015 earthquake, but the government is taking steps to restore it. The site is still accessible for travelers in Nepal.<br><br>
